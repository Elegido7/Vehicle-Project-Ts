Instructions

    The Project has defined an interface named Vehicle. The properties assigned are:
        make: string
        model: string
        year: number
        start method/function returns void and logs "Engine started" to the console as evident on the image folder.

    I have implemented a class named Car that implements the Vehicle interface.
    The Car class has:
        A constructor that initializes the make, model, and year properties.

    I have implemented the start method that is void to log "Car engine started" to the console.

    Finally an instance of the Car class was created to initialize it with some values of Toyota, Defender, 2023.

The start method on the instance of the Car class is called (Gari.start()) to verify that it logs ("Engine started") to the console.
Finally, the project was compiled into JavaScript and renamed through the terminal. It was run using Node appCar.js to ensure everything works as expected.
